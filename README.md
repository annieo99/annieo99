- 👋 Hi, I’m @annieo99
- 👀 I’m interested in how Web3 technology can be utilized in co-creating collective knowledge, as well as disrupt heirarchies of knowledge. Particularly interested in how this can enact positive change in the mental health sphere!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about community managment and DAO structures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building DAO's that create IRL equity or disrupt big pharma/psychology.
